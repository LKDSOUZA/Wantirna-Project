## Studies Importance

#### From previously searched and interest in real estate, it was an honour to actual dig deep the features in predicting the house prices in Melbourne. 

## Data search and importation

#### Data was imported from Kaggle dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market

## Data Filtering and Model Selection

#### Data was imported in Jupyter notebook. The information of number of data features has been shown in the image below
#### The number of unique values of each feature has been presented in the following image

### 1st Model selection

#### Simple linear model was selected including all the features results in,

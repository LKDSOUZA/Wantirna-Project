conda create -n wantirna_env python=3.7
```

- Activate this new environment before proceeding.

```bash
conda activate wantirna_env

# Note: If you run into issues, try the following command instead.
source activate wantirna_env
```

- Install the libraries into your new environment.

```bash
# install pip packages listed in requirements file 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

chmod a+x run.sh
```

Test the application by running the following in your command line.

./run.sh
```
